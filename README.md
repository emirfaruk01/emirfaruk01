As a Computer Engineering student at Uludaƒü University, I have developed a diverse skill set through hands-on projects and competitions. My experience spans desktop application development using C#, robotic coding with ROS, Python, and OpenCV, as well as web development with HTML and CSS. I have also delved into Java and Android Studio for mobile application development.

One of my key areas of interest is autonomous vehicle technologies, where I have actively participated in competitions and projects, enhancing my skills in image processing and robotic systems. My portfolio includes a variety of projects, from Windows desktop applications to Android apps, showcasing my versatility and commitment to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.

I am passionate about continuous learning and eager to contribute to innovative projects in the fields of robotics, software development, AI, and autonomous systems.
